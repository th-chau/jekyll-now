Imagine entering an examination hall where all examinees are constantly reminded that they are academically unequal, in which some are better than others. Imagine such differentiation produces results in which women, state-educated students and students with disabilities fare significantly worse. More importantly, imagine that actions that promote such a state of affairs are normalized, or even looked up upon.

This is Oxford in 2017, where students are constantly reminded of their past academic achievements in examinations through differentiated gowns, where entitlement is rarely recognized, let alone questioned. In a recent student referendum, 63% of students upheld the status quo in which certain students, primarily who attained good examination results previously, are entitled to wear a scholars’ gown in examinations.

The status quo gives a *choice* for scholars to wear the scholar's’ gown in examinations, and this entails responsibility that is seldom recognized. It is simply not good enough just to say: 

`I am entitled to X; hence, I am justified to do X`

Perhaps the consequences of exercising that entitlement is a pertinent matter to consider. In this case, exercising the option of wearing a scholar's gown during an examination has the undeniable effect of sending a signal of academic superiority over one’s peers in the examination venue. Perhaps this is too crude of a generalization, but the prime value of the scholars’ gown does stem from the fact that it is only conferred to a subset of students, and that membership of such subset is determined, primarily, by examination results. 

While most students barely pay attention to their peers’ gowns in examinations, some do, and this is already enough for us to question whether such entitlement is justified. Specifically, one must answer whether we ought to prioritize students’ ‘right’ to wear a gown over some other students’ wellbeing in a setting which may produce an outcome that affects them for life. A potential solution is to examine the outcomes in two states: one with the gown and one without. Not surprisingly, the scholars’ gown adds little other than a normalized channel of social recognition for high-achievers, who already are entitled to monetary awards and, surprise, recognition on transcripts. It will be quite ludicrous to suggest that academic standards will be noticeably dragged down if the gown is no longer in effect.

Above all, even if the gown incentivizes students to work hard academically, it is a perversion of what an education institution should achieve: treating knowledge and learning as an end in itself. Perhaps examinations are a necessary evil to measure learning outcome, but normalizing what would have otherwise been a questionable act of conspicuous show-off ought not be necessary, especially when many of those who elect to do so have the best intentions in mind. 

And this may be detrimental to those who wear a gown too. [Gilovich, Medvec and Savitsky (2000)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.1736&rep=rep1&type=pdf) showed that individuals with identifiable traits tend to overestimate the magnitude of others’ gazes on themselves, creating self-inflicted stress and anxiety. The scholars’ gown is above all a construct that affects scholars the most, as it is both a carrot and a stick – not only is pressure exerted on scholars (perhaps by themselves) to ‘live up’ to such an ideal, some colleges do and actually will take the gown away from scholars whom they believe are underperforming.

The scholars’ gown debate is a symptom of pervasive uncritical acceptance of privilege, and the lack of reflection over the potential consequences of such acceptance in Oxford. It is easy to fall for the notion that one should accept privilege entailed by one’s achievements. After all, we have accepted so much of privilege simply by being here.
