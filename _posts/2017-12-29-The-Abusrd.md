A friend of mine who is embroiled in college applications recently gave me a long spiel on why he thinks life is absurd after thinking that he underperformed at an interview. However, at the same time, he proclaimed that one should continue living only if the present is enjoyable, at least without strong suffering. While I think it is preposterous to claim that a failed interview makes life insufferable, his question is interesting.

Perhaps a utilitarian may agree with him, but suicide does not follow from absurdity.

Speaking as a person who does not believe that life in itself is meaningful or sanctimonious, I think he is wrong. Even if life is absurd, that our search for intrinsic value driven by our primitive instincts have no choice but to face our inability to find objective meanings in the universe (if there are), this is not a good reason for us to take our own life.

At face value, his assertion appears to be quite intuitive. Without resorting to religion or other man-made values, why should one live if the present is not enjoyable? 'It gets better' is a nice piece rhetorical device but carries little meaning given how great vicissitude is concerning the future. Life, at times, is just quite intolerable, and there really does not seem to be a good reason for us to keep on living.

I think there is an equivocation of two separate claims - giving up life due to pain (or the lack of future relief), and giving up life due to absurdity. It is the latter that is to be discussed, which is unrelated to whether the future is foreseeable or important. More importantly though, absurdity is not painful, nor should one suffer because of the fact that life is absurd.

One of the most well-known attempts to give an 'answer' came from Camus, in _The Myth of Sisyphus_; Camus proclaimed that the question of suicide is one of the most profound and important in philosophy. It is not really an answer as Camus does not give reasons as to why we should not commit suicide. However, he argued that there are lessons that one can learn from Sisyphus, even if the absurdity of life is obvious - that is the attitude towards absurdity can be of defiance. One can embrace life and to live with vigour even if it is absurd. Committing suicide, on the contrary, is an act of submission to our inalienable condition, without giving life a fight, a personal fight.

To digress, I never considered these problems before being asked to read [Thomas Nagel's The Abusrd](https://philosophy.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/The%20Absurd%20-%20Thomas%20Nagel.pdf) during my first interview at Oxford more than two years ago. It wasn't even that difficult; I was only asked to read the first two pages. Having no interest or knowledge in philosophy at the time, let alone the concepts in existentialism and absurdism, I did not comprehend what was conveyed for two reasons: I did not understand the writing, I also never pondered upon the inherent meaning of life. At that time, accepting what was told with no questions asked did not appear problematic to me. While I have always been overwhelmed by a deep sense for the fear of death, I just did not think too much about it - committing 'philosophical' suicide in the words of Camus I was.

Yet I digress.

As Nagel rightly argued, absurdity, really, is not a problem after all. He argued that the realisation of absurdity simply arises out of our 'capacity to transcend ourselves in thought'. It is a feature of us being capable of sophisticated reasoning. To make this agonising is a simple matter of choice. As such, we should face our absurdity with irony, instead of defiance or romanticism.

Perhaps this answer is unsatisfactory, as it is quite intuitively revolting that we are unable to find inherent meanings in our lives. Hence, I think many, including Camus, really just asserted that absurdity is a problem. Yet, I do not see a meaningful difference between such failure from, say, our inability to fulfill our childhood dream of jumping 100 meters, after accepting our objective irrelevance.
