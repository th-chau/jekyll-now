The conversation above took place moments ago in an event that supposedly aimed at debunking common 'myths' against Marxism. It did nothing remotely close to that. Defying the high expectations that I have held, the 'discussion' quickly descended into a spectacular display of group-think, and I think I entered an alternative reality.

Not only was dissent dismissed instead of carefully debated upon, the event also saw a fair share of [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism) when it comes to hard questions against Marxism. The answers to questions that touch upon potential critical aspects of socialism can be summarised in mantras such as 'capitalism is more X', or 'you see real X in capitalism'; this is quite reminiscent of the Soviet times, perhaps. While the veneer of open discussion was put up, legitimate questions were sidelined and drowned out by unobvious 'obvious facts'. For example, it is not that obvious that the information required for planning in private firms is comparable to central planning across the whole economy after the elimination of markets, or that China achieved great economic or social progress under command and rule economic policies. Well, how about the millions who perished due to hunger in the first 10 years of totalitarian rule under Mao? Does it have to be an aberration of economic planning? Foolish am I. This is so obvious.

Despite being a passionate believer in social justice, I think this falls far short of presenting a coherent picture of revolutionary socialism, let alone being convincing an audience who are exposed to current, capitalist ideologies on a daily basis.

The interesting question is: how can a group that is quite intellectually sophisticated, at least relatively speaking, live in this alternative universe? How can one be so resistant to mere questions that may challenge one's worldview? And, does this spell similarity with post-truth politics that are captivating  _en masse_ in the last year?

Empirical evidence shows highly intelligent and highly informed people are no less likely to be immune from resisting critical and challenging evidence. In fact, the converse is true -- Philip Converse's (no pun intended) [issue constraint](http://www.brucesabin.com/nature_of_belief_systems.html) experiments clearly showed that those with the highest levels of issue awareness and _perceived_ knowledge of the issue tend to be the most resistant to *facts* that are contrary to their original point of view. Note that we are talking about *facts not opinions*. This comes as no surprise: why should you change your mind if you have already known everything so well?

Moreover, the selection of information sources and the receptiveness to new stimuli are subject to strong influences from existing views (duh!) This is also known as the _perceptual screen_ - 'individuals see what is favourable to his ... orientation' (Campbell et al, 1960). Most interestingly, findings demonstrate that the *further* one is from the political median voter, the more likely one is going to see the world through the lens of the perceptual screen (Prior, 2013). In the case of radical politics, the empirical implications are profound: people honestly (and often with good intentions) regard news that do not fit their current worldview as fake news.

The grim reality appears to be that education and a more informed population are not the solution to greater political divide or the power of fake news. Increasing receptiveness to different facts and opinions is. The problem is, how?

The notion that there is nothing to lose but chains to step out of our ideological echo chamber is wrong - the above reliance on heuristics and a pathological in-group-out-group mentality can only partially mitigate the huge costs of going against many dominating ethos in society. Letting go of these intellectual crutches is never easy, for anyone. Or, perhaps, I seriously am the one who is living in the alternative universe.
