Some thoughts after a two-day trip.

Gdańsk witnessed some of the most significant events in European political history: the first Nazi majority legislature, the first shots fired in WWII in Europe, and the birthplace of the first recognised independent trade union in the Eastern Bloc. While Gdańsk captivates those who are interested in modern political history, the inhabitants' bravery demands deep reflection from all visitors. I feel a bit ashamed.

The Second World War and European Solidarity museums that I have visited are very immersive, partly due to my personal interest, partly due to the interactive and manifold exhibits and installations, and partly due to the intelligent audioguide system which guides visitors for the entirety of the exhibition. The sufferings faced by those who lived under the set of horrendous circumstances were aptly conveyed throughout the visit. Most important is that they tell common and human stories of struggle, pain and bravery; while being more Polish in focus, these interpretations managed to avoid common mistakes of heroism, triumphalism and victors' justice, (although this may not ![last that much longer](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/pawel-adamowicz/world-war-ii-museum-in-th_b_9867292.html); interestingly the new radical right-appointed director of the WWII museum fell into many of the above pitfalls with his welcoming note in the re-printed brochure).

What really struck me was the bravery and determination of people at critical junctures of history. Homo economicus would have never done anything like what the brave men and women did at that critical juncture of history. In face of overwhelming force, they chose to leap into faith - faith of a better tomorrow, faith in their fellow countrymen, faith in, I posit, the goodness of people. Even under the days of protracted negotiations between the opposition and the government, they persevered. Political science attempted to answer that with a theory of preference falsification; [this book](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674707580) by Timur Kuran attempted to explain why the masses suddenly rebelled, but, fundamentally, what drives people to commit to actions at such personal expense perhaps is a problem of political psychology.

Those who led the way to democracy are celebrated in democratic Poland, but many forget the many more who perished, especially the other uprisings leading up to this.

Perhaps being acutely aware of this fact, I just cannot foresee myself committing to this cause, however noble it is, at this degree of personal expense. My life, I may have come to believe, is simply too valuable to be a mere leverage for some vaguely defined greater good. Even if the personal cost is not so profound, I probably would have gleefully squatted at home if rebelling means I will lose my job.

Back to home, our democratic struggles have never reached the extent or scale of what I saw in Poland. Even though the Soviet Union was a more violently assertive external actor, collective struggles, if they ever come to their rare fruition, simple fizzle away. Perhaps, the robustness of liberal oligarchy is something that many, including myself, have underestimated.

Or, perhaps, circumstances simply make heroes, and it is a futile exercise for me to conceive of my actions under that set of circumstances.

On my returning flight, a gregarious lady, who is single mother raising a child in England as a migrant, said to me 'I will do whatever I can to make my son's life better.' And maybe, that is the key.
