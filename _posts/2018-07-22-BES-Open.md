Interesting outputs from my text mining script in the BES data set w.r.t. LGB candidates:
<!--more-->

> "Lib dem leader claiming to be a Christian but then saying he has no problem with perverts (homos) which is disgusting and disgracefu"

> "Cameron forced through gay marriage not even on his manefestotout. a"

> "I did not want to vote for a Tory or lib dem because they brought in gay marriage. I knew Labour could not win here, so no chance of the candidate winning!"

> "Conservatives are against gay rights (human rights) and promote the cowardly and desgusting pleasure of seeing an animal torn to pieces. This is not forward thinking, it’s psychotic"

> "Diane Abbott’s incompetence with figures/ Tim Farron being persecuted for his comments based in Christianity re. gay sex"

> "I discovered that the Tory candidate was in a “gay marriage""
