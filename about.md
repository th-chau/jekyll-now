### This Blog
Thoughts of an undergraduate scrambling through his degree; posts range from everyday life to the more academic to the deeper reflection.

The name of the blog comes from *Port Meadow* in Oxford, my favourite spot for reflection and the (occasional) self-talk.

### Me
I am a second-year undergradate reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford, keen to learn more about political sociology, wealth stratification, money in politics and voting theory.

I enjoy reading, hiking, city-cycling and thinking.
