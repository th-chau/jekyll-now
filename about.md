### This Blog
Thoughts of an undergraduate scrambling through his degree.

The name of the blog comes from *Port Meadow* in Oxford, my favourite spot for reflection.

### Me
I am a second-year undergradate reading Philosophy, Politics and Economics at the University of Oxford; narrowing down my interests is an urgent yet difficult task, these topics have so far caught my attention: gay politics, robustness of liberal oligarchies, authoritarian censorship, money in politics, among others.

Keeping my vegetarianism is at times difficult, but Peter Singer's [Animal Liberation](https://www.peta.org/about-peta/learn-about-peta/ingrid-newkirk/animal-liberation/) made a case that I cannot ignore.

I enjoy reading practical ethics, (and watching) cyberpunk Sci-Fi, hiking (in the walking sense), city-cycling and jogging. I will never say no to herbal tea and sparkling alcohol. I am trying to get better at the game of Go.

廣東話係我母語。
